This project was developed in three key phases:

General Chatbot
Initially, a conversational chatbot was created to handle general-purpose queries using natural language processing.

Document Chatbot
Next, a document-based chatbot was implemented, enabling users to upload files (PDF, DOCX, CSV, etc.) and ask context-aware questions based on the content.

Combined Chatbot
Finally, both functionalities were integrated into a single, user-friendly application, allowing seamless switching between general conversation and document-specific Q&A.
